# Batch-Processing-Pipeline-for-Carpark-Data
Developed a batch-processing pipeline to report car park entries and exits every 5 minutes. Mocked car park system data and stored it in a CSV file. Used Apache Airflow as the orchestration tool to automate data insertion into a PostgreSQL database every 5 minutes. Additionally, the data was transferred to Elasticsearch at the same interval, enabling visualization in Kibana.
